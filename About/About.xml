  <description>This mod is a hybrid of Slightly More Realistic Wool Production, and Shear Those Corpses. Also, I got tired of waiting for compatibility patches so I decided to make this for myself, figured I would put it on the workshop for anyone else who wanted it.
  
Shearable animals now yield fleece instead of wool, which needs to be processed into usable wool.
Also adds some fleece as a butcher product when butchering shearable animals.
As an added bonus, also adds a "patchleather" recipe for wools
  
Includes compatibility patches for Medieval Times, VGP, Legacy Ark, Megafauna, Vanilla Factions Expanded - Vikings, Anima Animals, ReGrowth - Extinct Animals Pack, Mamuffalo, Pygmy Muffalo, Erin's Mountain Animals, Forsakens: Fauna, Alpha Animals, Epona Race and Vanilla Animals Expanded
